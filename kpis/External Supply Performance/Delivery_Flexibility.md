# Delivery Flexibility

## Description
We measure the flexibility of an external supplier by indicating the extent to which a supplier can pocess unplanned orders or deliver already placed orders earlier to respond to possible demand peaks or low-quality materials.

## Calculation
`Number of unplanned orders fulfilled by supplier / Overall number of orders fulfilled by supplier`

## Scope of applicability
* Suppliers
* Own factory
